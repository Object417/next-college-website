# Next College Website

## About the assignment

Pearson Level 3 in Information Technology

Unit 6: Website Development &ndash; Assignment 2 &ndash; Developing a Website

The task is to design, make, test, and review a new website. The purpose of the
website is to advertise your website development skills. You can develop
a website on any topic, as long as it is appropriate.

Available pages:

- Homepage: <https://object417.github.io/next-college-website/>
- Courses: <https://object417.github.io/next-college-website/src/pages/courses.html>
- Art course: <https://object417.github.io/next-college-website/src/pages/art-course.html>
- Contact us: <https://object417.github.io/next-college-website/src/pages/contact-us.html>

De facto, there weren't any quality requirements of your website. You just had
to use HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS to create at least four pages with hyperlinks.
But anyway I decided to do my best and create an appropriate better version
of [the official college website](https://www.sheffcol.ac.uk/) while showing off
my web development skills.

I made this website fully myself from scratch. I designed it in Figma, reviewed
with my colleagues, made some improvements, then coded it, tested, fixed, and
reviewed its final version. [Rotherham college website](https://www.rotherham.ac.uk/)
was a good source of inspiration. However, I based my design decisions mostly
on community's best practices and my own user experience.

## Why is it called Next?

Initially, I was coding this project on React with Next.js. This would allow me
to make the website more interactive and easy-to-develop. However, at some point
I suddenly faced a very strange bug with Next.js that didn't allow me to run my
project. Because it was my first time tasting this library and I didn't have
much time left until the deadline, I decided to just give up and rewrite the
project in plain HTML, SASS, and JS. Do I regret this decision? Maybe yes. But
I ain't planning to rewrite the project on React in the nearest future because...
it works fine. Why would I waste my time doing the same thing when I can spend
this time on any other project that will give me a different kind of experience?

## Conclusions

This project allowed me to consolidate all my existing knowledge of making
up adaptive responsive websites while considering UX and general recommendations.
